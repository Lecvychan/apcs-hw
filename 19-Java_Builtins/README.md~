What is the difference between the HashMap and HashSet (or the TreeMap and TreeSet) from a use point of view.

Hashset
 -implements the Set interface.
 -stores only objects.
 -slower than Hashmap.
 -Add method is used to add element in set.

Hashmap
 -implements the Map interface.
 -stores data in the form of key value pair.
 -faster than Hashset because unique key is used to access objects.
 -Put method is used to add element in map.
